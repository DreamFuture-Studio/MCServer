# Version info, DON'T TOUCH
config-version: 13
 
# By default, it's in "both" mode.
#
# Available mode :
# - "both" : Prevent chat editing with multiple plugins by using all ways possible to edit the chat.
# - "auto" : Choose automatically between all available according to actual plugins.
# - "packet" : The working system for 1.4's ChatItem version (and older)
#        It was working with lot of others chat plugin, specially those who made hover text.
# - "chat" : New system which works without other chat plugin, which is simpler and with lower
#        amount of possible issues.
# You can replace 'both' by another mode that should correspond to what you want.
# If you don't know which one use, come on discord (link at begin of config or in spigotmc)
manager: "both"

#General configuration
general:
  # The placeholders to display an item in chat.
  placeholders:
    - "[i]"
    - "{item}"
  # The format of the item placeholders.
  name-format: "&b&l&o{name} {amount}&r"
  # The format of the {amount} placeholder.
  # {times} correspond to amount of item
  amount-format: "x{times}"
  # Should we use the translated item name or the custom name of an item
  color-if-already-colored: true
  # Should we always show the amount, even if it's just one
  force-add-amount: true
  #  Should we let the message through, as-is (with the placeholder not replaced)
  # if the user doesn't have permission or if the user is on cooldown?
  let-message-through: true
  # Should we allow users to show their hands off
  deny-if-no-item: false
  #  If the above (deny-if-no-item) is set to false, what should the placeholder be replaced with?
  # Bellow you can configure that behaviour.
  hand:

  #  Here you can choose which commands will the plugin attempt to parse. Console commands will all be ignored,
  # however player commands will be taken into consideration. To add a command, simply add an element to the list
  # bellow containing an alias (or name) for that command.
  #  It is enough to add only ONE alias for each command, and the others will automatically be supported. However,
  # this is only available for plugin commands. If you're planning to add bukkit or mojang commands here, you'll have
  # to manually specify ALL aliases for those.
  commands:
    - "msg"
  #  Here you can set when the players should see the no-permission message (defined in the 'Messages' section bellow).
  # 'normal' dictates whether the user should see the message when using the placeholder in normal chat, and 'command'
  # sets whether the user should see it when using the placeholder in a command.
